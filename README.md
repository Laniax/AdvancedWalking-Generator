## AdvancedWalking-Generator
Using this Generator you can take runescape map data and turn it into navmesh data which the main AdvancedWalking project is able to use.

In a nutshell, data from every tile in runescape is evaluated, grouped, optimized and serialized based on collision flags and ingame objects.

## Dependencies
It requires the main AdvancedWalking project. You should clone this repo in the root of that project.
